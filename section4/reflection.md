## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

* I'll be honest and say it sucked to try and try this technique on the most frustrating section. It started off okay, like I was able to set a timer during my readings and note taking and did feel a little more at ease and the information more digestible. But when I started the exercises, I found myself a bit frustrated because some small problems would take that allotted time and then I would be forced to walk away from it. Not to say that it wasn't effective, I certainly needed a boundary before I threw my computer across the room, but I think I could have benefitted from implementing it immediately.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

* Overall it went pretty well when outside circumstances weren't a factor. I found that I honored my intentions a bit more by writing them down and felt a little bit more focused. I think my time estimations were definitely a bit off but will get better with practice. I am in Austin and lost my power for this whole week so moving to a friends house, making sure my house was okay and my animals and partner were safe has been my priority so my focus hasn't been ideal.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* A way of storing data, or simply, a "thing" in your code that is defined by a characteristic (property). Arrays differ because they use index positions to fetch data, whereas objects you can use strings. Objects let us store more complex data with key-value pairs.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - ***Array*** because it can be an ordered list with just a string variable of the students name. You could also use built in methods to organize it.
  * List of states and their capitals - ***Object*** because we have all the states with their properties (capitals)
  * List of things to pack for vacation - ***Array*** because it's an ordered list with no other data to be stored and it would be easy with `pop` `push` etc. to add to or remove from the list as you go!
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow ***Array*** because we really only need to store that data in one variable and it's just a list of handles.
  * List of student names and their cohort - ***Object***
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake ***Object*** each ingredient will have a different property (amount of each ingredient)
  * All my favorite restaurants ***Array*** this one could go either way in my mind because if it was a ranked situation, which I've chosen to believe, it would be easy to organize by the index.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* Similarly, I imagine Venmo works fairly similarly. Some of the keys would be amount, date and pay or request (type) as well as the handle of the person you are getting or receiving money from, but also incorporates likes and comments (string like "wow you bought that?" or integer value for number of likes) like tweets would. Some methods would be adding comments , adding likes, pay or request money.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I definitely would like a firmer grasp on the `this.` method and how it works in the constructor function. I struggled since they get set to the same parameter to figure out the role they played in adding functions.
