## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* I found the SuperLearner article to be pretty encourage to read about. As someone who has been out of school for a bit, I fear that I've forgotten how to learn! In that, I will say that I do now view learning as a process, knowing I probably have a bit of catchup to do. One thing they noted that I do like to practice and have found success with it in and out of school is this idea that if you teach it, you know it. Sometimes I'll teach my partner something I've learned, just so I can get a grasp on my own understanding of the concept. 

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* **Number:** is pretty straightforward. This data type handles all numbers, which can include ones with decimals, like a float we learned from Mod0, and negative numbers.

* **Boolean:** a data type that evaluates a yes/no scenario, which usually reads as true/false.

* **String:** a data type that has special characters and letters, all wrapped up in single or double quotations.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`var greeting = "Hello World!"`
`console.log(greeting)`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
` // this is a comment`
`/* These help give more context to yourself and other devs about what is happening in your code. */`

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A **variable** is like filing cabinet. It holds information about something and keeps it organized and easy to reference back the details of that file because it has a name we can find on the tabs of the files!

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
`Amazon
var userName (string)
var cartTotal (number)
var cartIsEmpty (boolean) `

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

* A **concatenation** is a way to put together multiple variables using the `"+"` operator and strings

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

* I think any site that uses a `var userName` probably uses some sort of concatenation display a greeting with a `goodGreeting` to look something like ` console.log(goodGreeting + "," + userName!)`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I do wonder why you would use a concatenation versus an interpolation? Is one better for specific context?
