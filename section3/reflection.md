## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* I think the two points that resonated with me the most in the Growth Mindset article was that understanding that mistakes are essential to learning and not being afraid to seek help. Through the last exercises especially, there were small things that kept going wrong with my code but in doing that, I think I was able to work through some mistakes that I know won't happen very often now. And, if there was a situation where I couldn't understand my mistake, it's a good thing that we read about not being afraid to ask for help in the last sections! I've been keeping my eye on the Slack channel.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* The ones ways I demonstrate a Growth Mindset are the same ones I resonated with from the question above. The way I most notably don't demonstrate a Growth Mindset is practicing setting S.M.A.R.T. goals. I've mentioned previously, but I think sometimes I have trouble setting measurable goals because it falls under a category of organization to me that isn't my strong suit. I would love to take this approach on more as I go through Turing.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* If we're using MailChimp as an example, their main purpose of application is to create and manage mailing lists for companies and individuals for sending newsletters, etc. Certainly the most obvious use of an array for them is storing different users email addresses. Further I can imagine many array methods to remove and add to those addresses are used when evaluating a condition like if a user hits an "unsubscribe" button.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

*  **Array method** are functions that are  built into js that we can use on array data types. There are many but for example `var example = [1, 2, 3];

example.push;`
Where push is the *method* applied to the *example* array

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to perform a task that is repetitive and has condition to evaluate. In other words, it is a super fast way to do this rather than evaluating data one by one. In conjunction with an array, you are able to evaluate multiple values under the same condition at once. If you only have one value to evaluate, or a single string, then an array wouldn't be necessary, just the loop.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* Everyday right when you wake up, you brush your teeth. Brushing your teeth is the task you have to do when you wake up. Since it's everyday, that means you will always do the same task. Over and over again! Your requirement before brushing your teeth is to wake up, since you can't brush your teeth while you're asleep silly! That requirement, we would call a *condition*. A *loop* is way tell ourselves to repeat a task a certain amount of times (or forever!) based on a condition.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* The last question that we had in our loop array exercise was one that had multiple problems we had to address such as using a loop while also making if statements. I am wondering if there is multiple orders you could have done that in or if there is a set standard or more preferred order of operations?
